Project description
------------
Dino+ is a fork of [Dino](https://github.com/dino/dino), a modern XMPP/Jabber client written in Vala using GTK+, which includes a few relatively minor but important quality-of-life features. 

It was created due to upstream project's maintainers being seemingly unwilling to accept PRs from the community. As of March 2024, there are over 50 PRs pending, most of which are silently ignored.

Some of the features that Dino+ implements:

* Windows support
* Chat history "scroll-to-load" (both for 1-on-1 chats and MUCs), much like Conversations and Gajim
* Forced MAM sync for MUCs
* Password change via GUI
* Some additional QoL-features

What's currently in the works:

* Migrate build to Meson
* Fixes for sound notifications on KDE and some GTK-based platforms
* MacOS support for Mac silicon

Dino+ is currently to be considered an alpha-quality product. Please open an issue or send a PR if you find or fix any issues.

OS support
------------
* Linux (flatpaks are targeted for Ubuntu 22.04+)
* Windows 10\11

We only support 64 bit platforms.

Installation
------------
Have a look at our [releases](https://github.com/mxlgv/dino/releases).

Build on Linux
-----
Make sure to install all [dependencies](https://github.com/dino/dino/wiki/Build#dependencies).

    ./configure
    make
    build/dino

Build on Windows (x86_64)
------------
- Install and configure the [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) package;
- Go to `MINGW64` environment;
- Clone project:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/mxlgv/dino && cd dino
    ```
- Run the script to install dependencies:
    ```sh
    ./build-win64.sh --prepare
    ```
- Start the build (the builded distribution is available in the `windows-installer/dist-win64` folder):
    ```sh
    ./build-win64.sh
    ```
Note: the build script has some other options, their description can be found using the `--help`.

Build Windows Installer (NSIS)
------------
Before this, you must build the project according to the instructions above. It's worth making sure that `windows-installer/dist-win64` is not empty.
Now you should run:
```sh
./build-win64.sh --build-installer
```
